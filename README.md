# hello-world
first repository
My name is Greg, and I am learning coding.  My formal education is in accounting, but I have been working as a software implementer for 3 years.  I have learned progress4gl, SQL, html, CSS, and JavaScript. I am currently learning php.

This is all for a reason though - my passion has always been entrepreneurship and I am working on an idea I had with localization and agriculture.  I'm still building some vital systems I would need to fulfill this goal.
